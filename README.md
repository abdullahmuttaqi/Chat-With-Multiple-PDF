# Chat-With-Multiple-PDF

This application has been developed using the Streamlit library. It allows users to upload multiple PDF filesâ€”up to a total combined size of approximately 50 MB.
Once uploaded, the system intelligently analyzes the content of all the PDFs and provides highly accurate and context-aware responses to user queries.
If a question is relevant to the content of the uploaded documents, the system will generate a precise answer. However, if the question is unrelated or beyond the scope of the PDFs, the system will politely decline to answer
